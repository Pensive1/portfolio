## Personal Portfolio V1

Thanks for checking this repo. This website showcases my development work done thus far. I used this project as an opportunity to learn Next 13, TypeScript, CSS Grid and Tailwind CSS.

In the coming weeks, I aim to add more tweaks and features as I improve my knowledge of Next 13 and explore more design options.
